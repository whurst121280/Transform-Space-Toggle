# Transform Space Toggle

This is an addon for Blender that allows the user to assign a hoykey or mouse action to toggle between transform spaces.
This is very useful to animators and modelers who may need to swap between these spaces.
For example when animating you may want to move the center of gravity in World Pwsace, but then move the hand in Local Space.
This addon makes it quick and easy to switch between them on the fly.

The user can add any of the availible transform spaces built into blender to the list.
Items can also be removed, or re-ordered.

**DISCLAIMER**
For the sake of transparencey I am not a programer. I am great with logic, not syntax. This addon was created wiht the use of an LLM.
This addon was built and tested on Blender version 4.5.2. Shoudl be compatible with 4.5.x versions of Blender.
It will be updated as needed.
